I logged back in as the admin I created Jane Doe. This is how it looks as a help desk tech with tickets waiting to be worked. We will work these as if we are the ones that need to assign the tickets and move them along.

When you open up the first ticket to work you can then assign it to some to work, I assigned to myself in this lab, "Jane Doe".

Due to the severity of the situtation, I marked the SLA as a SEV-A which is 1 hour to work. This is can cause a loss in the business so we it's of high pirority!

I make a transfer of the ticket to the Sys Admin as this is going to need the Engineering team to work on patching or something more than I can. It's important to know which department to sent this crucial items to or ask if you're not 100% certain.

It's very important to update the person who created the ticket to let them know it's being worked on and once it's been taken care of so the front line workers that are face to face with customers can have the message ASAP.
