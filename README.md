Through the end user link I created a few tickets to work.

I logged back in as the admin I created Jane Doe. This is how it looks as a help desk tech with tickets waiting to be worked. We will work these as if we are the ones that need to assign the tickets and move them along. 
</p>

<p>
When you open up the first ticket to work you can then assign it to some to work, I assigned it to myself in this lab as "Jane Doe".

<p>
Due to the severity of the situtation, I marked the SLA as a SEV-A which is 1 HR to work. This is can cause a loss in the business so it's of high pirority! 
</p>

<p>
I make a transfer of the ticket to the SysAdmin as this is going to need the Engineering team to work on patching or something more than I can do as Help Desk. It's important to know which department to send crucial items to or ask if you're not 100% certain.

<p>
It's very important to update the person who created the ticket to let them know it's being worked on and once it's been taken care of so the front line workers that are face to face with customers can have the message ASAP.

In this ticket example I made the status high SLA level SEV-B 4 HR grace period. I assigned it John with a "warm hand off" which means I contacted him and checked to see if it was ok.

</p>
I worked this ticket as Jane Doe I made the status low SLA level SEV-C 8 HR grace period, for the lab I went ahead and showed a reply of what my response would be if I know the information and can respond quickly there's no sense to make someone wait for a simple quesiton. So then I closed out the ticket.
